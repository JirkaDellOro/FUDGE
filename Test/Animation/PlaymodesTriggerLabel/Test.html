        "Animations manipulate properties of a mutable object according to a given input, mostly time, along cubic splines.",
        "The properties to manipulate are given as AnimationStructure and can be nested, the input and output values as a AnimationSequence of AnimationKeys.",
        "They are combined as Animation and can be controlled by a ComponentAnimator to manipulate the other components of its container.",
        "Additionally, event-triggers may be installed with an animation to fire events when the input value passes the trigger input.",
        "To help navigating within an animation, labels may be defined."
      ],
      Setup: [
        "A cube with a transform- and an animator-component. An AnimationStructure references the x and y axis of the rotation of the transform",
        "A minimal sequence of two AnimationsKeys with adjustable input and output values, where input refers to time as is standard",
        "An Animation using the sequence and structure, with one event-trigger and a label, plus a framerate for discrete animation"
      ],
      Act: [
        "adjust point of time and value of the animation keys.",
        "adjust fps, the input-value of the event trigger and the time the label references.",

      Observe: [

        - REVERSELOOP plays animation like LOOP, but backwards <br>\
        - STOP causes the animation not to play at all",

        - CONTINOUS a loop of the animation lasts as long as the specified value of the second key <br> \
        - RASTERED_TO_FPS the animation depends on the specified fps, the animation is updated per frame <br> \
        - FRAMES Advances the time each frame according to the FPS value of the animation, ignoring the actual duration of the frames. Doesn't skip any frames"
