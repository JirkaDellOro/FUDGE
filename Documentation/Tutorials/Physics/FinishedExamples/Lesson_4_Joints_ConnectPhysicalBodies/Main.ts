    /*GOAL: Learning how to connect physical bodies with each other and what types of connections can be used to create different
            physical phenomena. And lastly how they can be influenced. In this tutorial not all joints are explained it's a means to get started,
            there are 6 types of joints in the Fudge Physics integration, once you understand prismatic/cylindrical joint the others are a combination
            of the learned techniques.
