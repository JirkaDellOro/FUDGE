          Rigidbodies are bascially defined by being a object with a mass and a shape of the object (also known as collider).
          Most of the times the shape and mass match the visual representation that is defined with cmpMesh and Transform.
          There are 3 Types of physical bodies:
            - Static:    Immovable, but interacting with other bodies, mostly used for things like obstacles, walls that are fixed
            - Dynamic:   Standard physical object, interacting with everything in a defined physical way,
                         Physical objects only listen to the physics engine, changing the transform will be overwritten by the physics integration.
            - Kinematic: Is able to interact with physical objects, but is controlled by transform/animation. Downside is it can not be moved by physics.
                         So colliding is only possible with dynamic objects it will move through static objects because kinematic objects try to push
                         everything but won't be pushed themselves, so if an object does not move away the kinematic will "glitch" through it.

        Node creation. And will be handled in a later tutorial. By having a smaller stepwidth you can decrease these problems. Best practice
        is to only use kinematic bodies when really needed. Player Characters should be dynamic bodies with special properties instead of kinematic bodies.
